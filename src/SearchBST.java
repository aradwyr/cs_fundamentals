/**
 * Search in a Binary Search Tree (BST)
 *
 * Given the root node of a BST and a value. You need to find the node in the BST that the node's value equals the
 * given value. Return the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn't exist, return NULL.
 *
 * Note: An empty tree is represented by NULL, therefore you would see the expected output (serialized tree format) as [], not null.
 *
 * e.g. IN: [4,2,7,1,3] and 2, OUT: [2,1,3]
 * Given the tree:
 *         4
 *        / \
 *       2   7
 *      / \
 *     1   3
 *
 * Return the subtree:
 *       2
 *      / \
 *     1   3
 *
 * Complexity: O(log n) avg time, O(n) worst time, O(1) space
